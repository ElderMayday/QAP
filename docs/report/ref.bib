abstract = {This paper presents HAS-QAP, a hybrid ant colony system coupled with a local search, applied to the quadratic assignment problem. HAS-QAP uses pheromone trail information to perform modifications on QAP solutions, unlike more traditional ant systems that use pheromone trail information to construct complete solutions. HAS-QAP is analysed and compared with some of the best heuristics available for the QAP: two versions of tabu search, namely, robust and reactive tabu search, hybrid genetic algorithm, and a simulated annealing method. Experimental results show that HAS-QAP and the hybrid genetic algorithm perform best on real world, irregular and structured problems due to their ability to find the structure of good solutions, while HAS-QAP performance is less competitive on random, regular and unstructured problems.},
